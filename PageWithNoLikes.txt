Assume you're given two tables containing data about Facebook Pages and their respective likes (as in "Like a Facebook Page").

Write a query to return the IDs of the Facebook pages that have zero likes. The output should be sorted in ascending order based on the page IDs.

SELECT p.page_id
from pages p left JOIN
page_likes l on p.page_id=l.page_id
where l.liked_date is NULL
group by p.page_id
ORDER BY p.page_id asc
